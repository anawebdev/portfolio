**How to improve**

-	  performance: by using browser cache
-   performance: by minifying files
-   cross browser compatibility: by adding a deparate stylesheet for IE and Safari

-   Safari does not display path animations correctly and the canvas particle network library
-   appearance: changing the order in which columns display after reaching their breakpoints might improve UX on mobile
